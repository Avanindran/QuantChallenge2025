# QuantChallenge2025
My personal attempts to train a model on Challenge data and predict the target variable on out-of-sample data.

# Results
Adjusted R2 score of 0.69 when using the combined predicted values of this LGB model and Random Forest Regressor

# Future considerations
Despite teammates doing cross-validation on my model and including their own, I should run my own K-fold CVs for greater confirmation and robustness of model
greater emphasis on minimising error metrics such as RMSE, MSE, MAPE and other metrics could be the focus instead of maximising R2
